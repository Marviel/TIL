# State Machines in C++
## Boost---StateChart
### Brief Description
I've been using this for some embedded systems work recently. The AutoDesk Ember also relies on it heavily in its firmware--handling such things as important as managing safety interlocks.

I have yet to learn a lot about this system that I can put into words--but I'll update here as I learn more.
