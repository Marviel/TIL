Kernel Extensions, or "kext"s, are pretty useful little bits of code.
I don't know much about writing them, but sometimes I have to use them.

The cmdline tools listed here have helped: (https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/KEXTConcept/Articles/command_line_tools.html)
And are summarized below.

    kextutil
Allows you to test if a kext can be loaded, among other things.

    kextstat
VERY useful---run with no args, tells you all kexts that are loaded.
I had to use this to see that HoRNDIS wasn't loading properly when debugging a beagleboneblack's connection via usb.

    kextlibs
Tells you what libraries your kexts need. Seems useful, but haven't needed it yet.

    kextfind
Allows you to search for kexts.
