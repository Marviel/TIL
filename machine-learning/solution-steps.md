### Cleaning the Data
- Check if there are columns with missing data. If there are, and those are columns we care about, then consider using some form of imputation ([SimpleImputer](http://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/generated/sklearn.impute.SimpleImputer.html#sklearn.impute.SimpleImputer) will work in many cases).
